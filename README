# lein-clojurescript

leiningen plugin for clojurescript compilation.

NOTE!  clojurescript compiler needs clojure-1.3.0 to run 
       and since this is a plugin that runs the compiler
       it needs leiningen to boot with 1.3.0 (current stable & master branches are on 1.2.1)
       until its released I have a build of lein in 1.3.0 RC0
       https://github.com/bartonj/leiningen/downloads
       you can copy the jar to your ~/.lein/self-installs and change the LEIN_VERSION 
       variable at the top of lien (or lein.bat) script to be 2.0.0-SNAPSHOT

See clojure.org for clojurescript details.
See code.google.com/closure for google closure details.
See github.com/technomancy/leiningen for lein details.

## Usage

In your project.clj add a dev-dependency
    :dev-dependencies [[lein-clojurescript "1.0.0-SNAPSHOT"] ...]

If you'd like the plugin to hook into the normal compile add to the hooks list:
    :hooks [leiningen.clojurescript ...] 

To compile clojurescript files in src:
lein clojurescript

To compile clojurescript along with a normal compile:
lein compile

Compile with advanced mode: 
lein compile '{:optimizations :advanced}'
